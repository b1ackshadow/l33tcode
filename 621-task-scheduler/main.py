#
# When n is smaller than the number of unique tasks, the reason the total number of tasks becomes the minimum required intervals lies in how the gaps are distributed:
#
# Key Points:
# When n < tasks:
#
# The n interval constraint between identical tasks becomes less restrictive because there are enough other tasks to "fill the gaps" naturally.
# The scheduler doesn't need to leave idle slots since tasks can occupy all intervals.
# Why This Works:
#
# The core formula (f_max - 1) * (n + 1) assumes that there arenâ€™t enough tasks to fill gaps created by the most frequent task.
# However, when the number of unique tasks is large enough, the gaps are filled by other tasks, making idle slots unnecessary.
# Example to Explain:
# Input:
# plaintext
# Copy code
# tasks = ["A", "A", "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"], n = 1
# Step 1: Analyze Frequencies:
# A: 3, B: 1, C: 1, D: 1, E: 1, F: 1, G: 1.
# Step 2: Calculate Using (f_max - 1) * (n + 1):
# f_max = 3 for A.
# Total slots = (f_max - 1) * (n + 1) + count_max = (3 - 1) * (1 + 1) + 1 = 5.
# Step 3: Compare Slots and Tasks:
# Total tasks = 9. Calculated slots = 5.
# Since n is small and there are many tasks, the gaps from A can easily be filled by other tasks (B, C, D, E, F, G).
